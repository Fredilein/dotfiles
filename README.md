Personal config files for:
- nvim
- tmux
- zsh

## Sources
Theme and some of the tmux config is from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vimporn/comments/bxjd4p/cant_q_tinkering/).

## Info
`.vimrc` is not in use anymore. Since I switched to neovim, every vim related config is in the `config` folder.
